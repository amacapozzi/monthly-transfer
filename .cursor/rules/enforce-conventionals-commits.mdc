# RULE: Enforce English + Conventional Commits
# ==========================================
# Cursor must follow these rules at all times:
rules:
  - id: enforce_conventional_commits
    pattern: "commit"
    behavior:
      preferred_language: "en"
      description: >
        When generating commit messages, always use Conventional Commits format.
        Never write comments or explanations. Only output the commit message itself.
        The format must be:
        <type>(<scope>): <short, imperative description>
        Allowed types: feat, fix, docs, style, refactor, perf, test, build, ci, chore, revert.
        Keep all descriptions short, direct, and in English.
        Do not include line breaks unless needed for BREAKING CHANGE.
        Do not include comments or additional text around the commit.
        Commit examples:
        feat(api): add monthly transfer endpoint
        fix(server): handle null request body
        chore(config): update lint settings
